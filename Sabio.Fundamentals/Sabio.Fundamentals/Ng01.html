                <ul>
                    <li>Basic controller coding in a IIFE with named constructor.</li>
                    <li>Capture variable (vm) for the controller.</li>
                    <li>Controller-As syntax.</li>
                    <li>Expose a scalar property and method as the public interface of the controller.</li>
                    <li>Use one-way data dinding in the HTML template to render controller property using an Angular expression.</li>
                    <li>Use ng-click directive to wire-up a button click event to the controller method.</li>
                    <li>Controller private method changes state of controller - exposedd through the myMessage controller property.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>


            <p>{{exVm.myMessage}}</p> <!--One way data binding (declarative style)-->
            <button type="button" data-ng-click="exVm.changeMessage()">Click Me</button>
            <p>
                This example demonstates and explains the basics of properly setting up an
                angular controller.

        // Calling angular.module with two args defines a new
        // module and registers it with angular's "IOC container".
        // The string supplied as the first arg to the modulr function
        // is the name that you will need to use to reference the
        // module later.
        // When angular processes the ng-app directive, it will
        // actually instantiate (create) the registered module.
        // To later "get" a reference to this module, we can call the
        // module method with a single argument (the name of the module)
        // to get a reference to the existing module.
        // [Y021] Though the module method does return a reference to the module
        // object, and you will see this in some examples, this is not
        // needed or recommended, since it "pollutes" the global namespace.
        // [Y023] Only set a module once, but get as often as needed.
        //References To John Papa Guide Below
        //https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/blob/master/a1/README.md
        angular.module('mainApp', []);

        // We register a controller with angular by first
        // getting the module as described above, then calling
        // the controller method, where we specifiy the controller
        // name and pass it a constructor function. When angular
        // processes an HTML template and encounters an ng-controller
        // directive with a matching controller name, angular will
        // call the constructor function to create an instance of the
        // controller and bind it to the DOM where the directive occurred.
        // [Y024] Though many examples will use in-line anonymous
        // functions, use named constructor functions instead, since they
        // reduce the nesting of your code, are easier to read, and
        // prevent problems that can be introduced during code minification.
        angular.module('mainApp')
            .controller('exController', ExController);

        function ExController() {
            // Use a "capture variable" vm, which stands for ViewModel
            // [Y032] The this keyword is contextual and when used within
            // a function inside a controller may change its context. Capturing
            // the context of "this" avoids this problem. Any properties
            // added to the vm object will be bindable to the DOM using
            // directives.
            // [Y031] use vm instead of $scope to reference the scope. You may
            // still need to use $scope occasionally (e.g. for $emit, $broadcast fns).
            var vm = this;

            // Define the various properties and methods that
            // you want to be able to access from the DOM, by
            // adding properties to the vm (i.e., the controller).
            vm.myMessage = "Angular is rendering on the page";
            vm.changeMessage = _changeMessage;

            // "The fold". [Y033] Place bindable members the top of the controller,
            // and define detailed functionality in named functions below.
            // This makes it easier for developers looking at the code to
            // find the "public" properties that comprise the viewmodel without
            // having to dig through the  implementation details. If the
            // controller was written on paper, the public interface should be
            // above where you might fold the page in half vertically.

            // [Y034] Implement behaviors as named functions preceded with an underscore
            // as an indication that they are "private". These will be hoisted
            // by the JavaScript interpreter to the top of the constructor function,
            // so they are accessible to bindable property definitions, but still
            // appear out of the way below the fold.
            function _changeMessage() {
                vm.myMessage = "Changed my message with a click";
            }
